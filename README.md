This is my Campus_ebay apllication created using typescript and tailwind css .
The folders and files in it have been segregated efficiently for any reader to understand the code.
Feel free to check-out all the end points.
I have taken few components such as the Blogskeleton and the spinner from flowbite.
Rest of the code is original.
